                <h1>Hello 42 Players!</h1>
                <p>
                    If you are new to 42-online, we welcome you and
                    invite you to join our online 42 community. We are
                    moving from a privately developed, Windows program
                    that was approaching 25 years in age to a new, modern
                    browser-based application that is no longer limited to
                    a Windows desktop or laptop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those of you who have been members of the 42-online
                    community, we now have a new site. Unfortunately, we will no
                    longer have the old game as the platform which was
                    home to that site was upgraded and the repairs to the
                    game software would require extensive time and effort.

                    The Tournament Directors (TDs) and the program creator
                    met and made the decision that now was the right time to
                    move forward solely with the new site based on the
                    circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let us introduce you to <a href="https://fortee2.com">fortee2.com</a>
                    which is a new browser-based 42 game. It works on Windows and Apple
                    computers as well as tablets!
