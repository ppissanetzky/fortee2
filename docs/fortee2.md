[fortee2](https://fortee2.com) is a website that lets anyone play 42 online, for free.

## Getting in

For now, fortee2 is **invite-only** and the invitations are handled through **Slack**. To get an invitation to play, ask one of your friendly 42-online TDs and give them your e-mail address.

When your invitation is processed, you will receive an **e-mail from Slack** that looks like this:

When you receive it, click on **JOIN NOW**, which will open up your browser to a page that looks like this:

![slack join](images/slack-join.png)

Fill in your name, and hit **Continue**. This should take you to our **Slack "workspace"**, where you can meet everyone else that has been invited. You will automatically join a "channel" called **#general** full of friendly people that are more than willing to help. Just say hello!

If you lose your way, simply follow [this link](https://fortee2.slack.com) to open up Slack in your browser.

### Tablets and phones

If you try to do this on a tablet or a phone, you may be prompted to install the Slack app.

**DON'T INSTALL THE SLACK APP** - just open up Slack in your browser.

If you lose your way, simply follow [this link](https://fortee2.slack.com).

## The website

Slack is just a means to create an account and get help. To play games and signup for tournaments, you have to go to the [fortee2 website](https://fortee2.com). Once there, hit the **PLAY** button.

The first time you do this, you will be taken to a page that looks like this:
